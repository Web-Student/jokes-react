A Joke database in React

Fall 2024 Final Project Proposal
An elevator pitch of your project (something you can say in less than 1 minute
This will be a joke database. Users can create a joke. Users can go to a page and get a random joke of the day (I want that to be the landing page, in a way, where you are greeted with a joke.
The names of the contributors (if you are working with a partner)
Just me
A rough list of features (this needs to be large enough to satisfy the "scope" requirements)
Joke generator (pulls from the database)
Add a joke
 (because we track author, uses authentication/authorization if you want your joke attributed to you)
View all jokes
 Search for a joke. This will search the database of all the jokes, filtering by whatever word you put in, whatever author you put, etc.
Author Selection page 
This will show all the different authors, and you have to click on them to see their jokes
Jokes submitted by the aforementioned author.
Edit/delete a joke you previously submitted 
Submit a request to edit another userâ€™s joke. (perhaps the author had a typo)
Review requests for edit on your joke, and approve or deny them.
A list of new things you will need to do to accomplish your project (e.g. websockets)
Not new to the class, but things s i still feel shaky on but are not technically new
Reusable layout components
authorization/authentication (determining the current user, syncing them with the db, etc)
